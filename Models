# Model Storage Information

The trained models for this project are **NOT included** in this GitHub repository because the files are extremely large (1–4 GB depending on the model).

Models used:
- xgboost_model.pkl (Small, included)
- scanner_hybrid_final.keras (Large, kept local)
- cnn_residual_model.keras (Large, kept local)

Due to size limits, the model files are stored externally and can be accessed upon request.
