# Model Storage Information

The trained models for this project are **NOT included** in this GitHub repository because the files are extremely large (1–4 GB depending on the model).

Models used:
- CNN-based Scanner Classifier (~2.1 GB)
- PRNU Noise Pattern Model (~1.4 GB)
- RandomForest + Feature Extractor Model (~700 MB)

Due to size limits, the model files are stored externally and can be accessed upon request.
